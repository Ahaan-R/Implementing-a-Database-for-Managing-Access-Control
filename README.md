Design and implement a database for keeping track of information about a
DBMS subsystem for managing discretionary access control. The first step involves designing an EER
schema diagram for this database application. Then, mapping the EER schema into a
relational database schema and implement it on MySQL.
Finally, Data can be loaded into the database, and create some queries to update transactions.
